If you are new to GitHub, you should check out this [blog post by Lauren
Orsini](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1).
However, for this class you only need to know how to download content from the
repo.


A simple way to get the files off of GitHub is to download them
manually. To do this:

1. Click on the folder that contains the file you are interested in.
2. Click on the file you are interested in downloading.
3. On the top right corner you will see a button that reads <code>Raw</code>.
4. Right click on <code>Raw</code> and select "Save Linked File"
5. Depending on your browser, it will either download automatically or you can choose where to download it on to your machine.
6. You should now be able to read and edit the file.

However, we will **NOT** be doing this. Instead, we are going to use
the built-in capabilities of RStudio to interface directly with this
GitHub repository using the git version control software.

Instructions:

MacOS

Windows

Ubuntu
